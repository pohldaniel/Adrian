This repository contains a Visual Studio 2015 setup of https://code.google.com/archive/p/adrian/ and it's dependencies. Only **release x86** will build. It should be clear that the Copyright of xmoto and of it's dependencies are not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
